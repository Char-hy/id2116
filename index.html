    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my profile page.</h1>
    <p>I am Charlotte Ho, an Industrial Designer currently studying in the National University of Singapore. My design journey began 12 years ago - As my family could not afford to be extravagant, I made everything that I wished I had as a hobby. Over time, that hobby developed into a passion and eventually, a career. If you would like to know more about me and my design journey, feel free to visit my professional <a href="charlotteho.weebly.com">website</a> !</p>
    <p>I created this page for a computing module under the guidance of my professor, Yuta. Here, I will be documenting my thoughts and learning takeaways about computing throughout the semester so stay tuned if you are interested :> In this module, we are also grouped in pairs. My teammate is Kianne. Feel free to check out her profile page in the link below!</p>
