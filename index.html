    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my profile page, I am Charlotte Ho.</h1>
    <p>
      I am an Industrial Designer currently studying in the National University of Singapore.
      My design journey began 12 years ago - As my family could not afford to be extravagant,
      I made everything that I wished I had as a hobby. Over time, that hobby developed into a passion and eventually, a career.
    </p>

    <p>As a designer, I strive to demonstrate these attributes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Curiousity.</i>
          <p>
          I am always seeking new experiences! Perhaps this is why I became interested in henna art,
          or the reason why youâ€™ll find me engaging in various activities of going for events and dialogue sessions.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Diligence.</i>
          <p>
          I believe in consistently doing my best, even if it means going the extra mile.
          This is because I want my work to be the best representation of me and my learning progress.
          I do this by setting personal goals, aside from the ones my teacher or employer has for me.
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Growth.</i>
          <p>
            I believe that there is always something to learn in every experience and I believe in
          the value of a challenge. This is why I pushed myself to present in Mandarin during my internship in Shanghai, China.
          </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

      This page was created for a computing module under the guidance of my professor, Yuta.
      And in this module, we were grouped in pairs. My teammate is Kianne.
      Feel free to check out her profile page in the link below.

      With regards to computing, my knowledge bank is like a blank, white 70gsm paper - empty and filmsy.
      But thirtheen weeks later, I hope my knowledge bank becomes a colourful,
      120gsm paper - bursting with new-found knowledge with a robust foundation.
      Throughout the semester, I will attempt to learn and apply as much as I can and week by week,
      I will fill this page with my thoughts and learning takeaways so stay tuned if you are interested &#128515
