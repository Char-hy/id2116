    <h1>Hello! Welcome to my profile page.</h1>
    <p>I am Charlotte Ho, an Industrial Designer currently studying in the National University of Singapore. My design journey began 12 years ago - As my family could not afford to be extravagant, I made everything that I wished I had as a hobby. Over time, that hobby developed into a passion and eventually, a career. If you would like to know more about me and my design journey, feel free to visit my professional website!</p>

    <p>This page was created for a computing module under the guidance of my professor, Yuta. And in this module, we were grouped in pairs. My teammate is Kianne. Feel free to check out her profile page in the link below.</p>

    <p>Just a little about me... A few of my strengths include...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strength01</li>
        <li>Strength02</li>
        <li>Strength03</li>
        <li>Strength04</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With regards to computing, my knowledge bank is like a blank, white 70gsm paper - empty and filmsy. But thirtheen weeks later, I hope my knowledge bank becomes a colourful, 120gsm paper - bursting with new-found knowledge with a robust foundation. Throughout the semester, I will attempt to learn and apply as much as I can and week by week, I will fill this page with my thoughts and learning takeaways so stay tuned if you are interested &#128515</p>
