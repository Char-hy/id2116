    <p><i>17.01.2020</i></p>
    <p>
      Even though I went through an introductory class of JavaScript from Codecademy, I went for my first class in ID2116 feeling worried.
      I knew next to nothing about computing and knew that I could be slow to pick up on things sometimes.
      Thoughts like, "What if the class moves too fast and I get left behind?" and "What if, by the end of today, I am completely confused and I don't even know what I don't know?"
      Thank goodness, I did not go home completed confused.
    </p>
     <p>
      The class begin with an intoduction of the module before moving onto the micro:bit. Thank goodness I watched a video about it the night before
      because if I had not, I probably would have been too busy feeling anxious to be able to enjoy myself with the micro:bit.
      The micro:bit is truly an amazing, tiny thing that can accomplish so much - and I bet it is capable of more fascinating things when
      we marry its capabilities with our creativity.

        Here are some of the objects that I brainstormed. To achieve interesting and interactive results, I figured that the objects
        should be able to move in a spectrum, with a gradual and adjustable motion.

    <p>
      Today's class was a session of confusion for me. We learned how to create our own webpage with HTML and CSS.
      Everyone seemed to be ahead of me and I felt like I was annoying the people around me with my anxiousness and questions.
      I need to calm down.
      I think this was because the things we did were step-by-step progressive things, so since I missed the first few steps,
      I could only struggle in stagnation while others moved ahead. It's a terrible feeling.
    </p>
    </p>
      We also continued learning with the micro:bit today, with the inclusion of electrical components. I was so lucky to have had some
      experience with electrical components in Ngee Ann, or I would not have been so calm in assembling the electrical arrangement.
      Together with Kianne, I was able to
      <li>Make an LED blink;</li>
      <li>Control button inputs;</li>
      <li>Adjusting a variable resistor.</li>
    </p>
    <p>
      The last one was a little tricky because the adjustable switch was a little different from the diagram, so making it work required
      some technical knowledge.
