    <h2 id= "Week 1:">Week 1 : Introduction to ID2116 and the micro:bit.</h2>
    <p><i>17.01.2020</i></p>
    <p>
      Even though I went through an introductory class of JavaScript from Codecademy, I went for my first class in ID2116 feeling worried.
      I knew next to nothing about computing and knew that I could be slow to pick up on things sometimes.
      Thoughts like, "What if the class moves too fast and I get left behind?" and "What if, by the end of today, I am completely confused and I don't even know what I don't know?"
      Thank goodness, I did not go home completed confused.
    </p>
     <p>
      The class begin with an intoduction of the module before moving onto the micro:bit. Thank goodness I watched a video about it the night before
      because if I had not, I probably would have been too busy feeling anxious to be able to enjoy myself with the micro:bit.
      The micro:bit is truly an amazing, tiny thing that can accomplish so much - and I bet it is capable of more fascinating things when
      we marry its capabilities with our creativity.

        Here are some of the objects that I brainstormed. To achieve interesting and interactive results, I figured that the objects
        should be able to move in a spectrum, with a gradual and adjustable motion.

    <h2 id= "Week 2:">Week 2 : Introduction to HTML, CSS and more on the micro:bit</h2>
    <p><i>23.01.2020</i></p>
    <p>
      Today's class was a session of confusion for me. We learned how to create our own webpage with HTML and CSS.
      Everyone seemed to be ahead of me and I felt like I was annoying the people around me with my anxiousness and questions.
      I need to calm down.
      I think this was because the things we did were step-by-step progressive things, so since I missed the first few steps,
      I could only struggle in stagnation while others moved ahead. It's a terrible feeling.
    </p>
    </p>
      <ul>
        We also continued learning with the micro:bit today, with the inclusion of electrical components. I was so lucky to have had some
        experience with electrical components in Ngee Ann, or I would not have been so calm in assembling the electrical arrangement.
        Together with Kianne, I was able to...
          <li>Make an LED blink;</li>
          <li>Control button inputs;</li>
          <li>Adjusting a variable resistor.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="videos/gif_widescreen.gif" alt="Adjusting a variable resistor" style="width:800px;height:450px;" class="center">
    <p>
      The last one was a little tricky because the adjustable switch was a little different from the diagram, so making it work required
      some technical knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      LEARNING TAKEAWAYS
      <ul>
        <li>Creating my very own webpage with HTML and CSS (after spending a day on it)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      HOMEWORK
      <ul>
        <li>Attach micro:bit to chosen object and document findings;</li>
        <li>Create own webpage for my weekly documentation (aka this page!!);</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
    <p>
      I still don't really know what product I want to use yet, but I guess there is no time to hesistate. I have to start already!
      But for the webpage, I am so happy to say that I managed to clarify all my doubts and create a webpage by myself!
      Althought I spent a whole day++ doing this, I am so glad I did. Going through Yuta's step-by-step document again
      (with the luxury of time) made things clear!
    </p>
    <p>
      After being able to accomplish the basics as taught in class, I began to seek other ways to improve my webpage. In the end,
      I was able to learn how to...
      <ul>
        <li>Add hyperlinks (for pages within and outside this webpage);</li>
        <li>Adding a horizontal line (for segmantation);</li>
        <li>Breaking a line (like "enter", except that html ignores and "enters" made here and the words just clump up);</li>
        <li>Creating margins (this improved the look of the webpage significantly);</li>
        <li>Creating a link that allows readers to scroll straight to a specific spot on the page;</li>
        <li>Adding emojis and gifs.</li>
      </ul> 
    </p>
