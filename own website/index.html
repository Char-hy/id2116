    <h1>Hello! I am Charlotte and this is my website.</h1>
    <p>I am a Industrial Designer currently studying in the National University of Singapore. My design journey began in 2008 as I made everything that I wished I had. Over time, that hobby developed into a passion, and eventually, a career. Feel free to visit my professional website at charlotteho.weebly.com if you are curious about what I do, or stay tuned here if you are interested to read my mental blehs :)</p>
